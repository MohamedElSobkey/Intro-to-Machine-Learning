# 1. Learn Basics Concept of Python

# What is Python?

*  Created in 1991 by Guido Van Rossum
*  Named after Monty Python’s Flying Circus
*  Is an interpreted, Object-Oriented, High Level Programming Language with dynamic semantics.
*  Gained popularity because of its clear syntax and readability


# Why Learn Python?

Python’s syntax is very easy to understand. The lines of code required for a task is less compared to other languages. Let me give you an example – If I have to print “Welcome To Edureka!” all I have to type:

print (“Welcome To Edureka!”)

Let’s see, What experts have to say about Python:

* Simple and Easy to learn
* Free and open source
* High Level Language
* Support different programming paradigm
      *  Object Oriented
      * Procedure Oriented
      *  Functional Oriented
      *  Imperative Oriented
* Portable      


#  2. Downloading & Installation

I will be installing Python in Windows 10 OS. You can try installing Python in Linux, Mac etc. If you face any issue mention it in the comments section.

## Following are the steps to install Python

*  Step1: 1. Go to www.python.org/downloads/
*  Step2: Select the Operating System and also the version of Python. I am downloading 3.6.0 in my windows machine. Open the installer and click on “Run”.
*  Step3: Click on “Install Now” and check on “Add Python 3.6 to PATH”.
*  Step4: Start IDLE which is a Python GUI and start scripting.

#  Python IDE (Integrated Development Environment):

IDE typically provides code editor, compiler/ interpreter and debugger in one GUI (Graphical User Interface). It encapsulates the entire process of code creation, compilation and testing which increases the productivity of developers.

A developer working with an IDE starts with a model, which the IDE translates into suitable code. The IDE then debugs and tests the model-driven code, with a high level of automation. Once the build is successful and properly tested, it can be deployed for further testing through the IDE or other tools outside of the IDE.


#  3. Python Applications:

*  Artificial Intelligence
*  Data Science
*  Desktop Application
* Automation
* Web Development
* Data Wrangling, Exploration And Visualization

# 4. Python Variables

* A Python variable is a reserved memory location to store values. In other words, a variable in a python program gives data to the computer for processing.
* Variables are containers for storing data values. Unlike other programming languages, Python has no command for declaring a variable.

#  Python Variable Name Rules

   *   Must begin with a letter (a - z, A - B) or underscore (_)
   *   Other characters can be letters, numbers or _Case Sensitive.
   *   Can be any (reasonable) length.
   *   There are some reserved words which you cannot use as a variable name because Python uses them for other things.


#  Python Tokens
   * Keyword
       * Python keywords are special reserve keywords
   * Identifiers
       * Names that the programmer defines
   *   Literals
       *  Values classified by types: e.g., numbers, truth values, text
  *    Operators 
       *  Symbols that operate on data and produce results


#  5. Python Tokens: Keywords

 *  Python keywords are special reserve keywords
 *  Convey a special meaning to the compiler/interpreter
 * Each keywords have a special meaning and a specific operation
 *  Keywords CANNOT be used as variable

# 6. Python Tokens: Identifiers
  
  *  Identifiers are the name to identify a variable, function, class or an object
  *  RULES defined for naming an identifiers:
                *   No special character except underscore (_) can be used as an identifier
                *   Keywords should not be used as an identifiers
                *   Python is case sensitive, i.e. Var and var are two different identifier
                *   First character of an identifier can be character, underscore(_) but not digit.
